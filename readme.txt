Title: Modeling the elastic response of Earth’s crust to hydrological loading using GRACE data and
comparison with GPS observations
Summary: The Earth deforms elastically under gravitational force of surface loads including
atmospheric, oceanic and hydrological masses. The hydrological loading is often the largest component
of surface mass changes. GRACE satellites provide monthly variations of total water storage at scales
of 300 – 500 km. Using the elastic loading theory, these forcing data can be used to model crustal
deformation. As an independent technique, GPS is capable of measuring crustal deformation resulting –
among many other processes – from hydrological loading. In this project, the student will use monthly
GRACE spherical harmonic coefficients from 2002 to 2017 and model the vertical deformation using a
PREM Earth model. The modeled deformation are compared with GPS height time series at GPS sites
in a study area.

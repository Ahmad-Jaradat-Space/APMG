=== GRACE SCALING FACTOR TEST ===

Loading current analysis results...
Testing GRACE deformation for 8 time points...

=== CURRENT GRACE PERFORMANCE ===
GRACE range: 3.19 mm (-0.26 to 2.94)
GRACE std: 1.24 mm

=== GPS COMPARISON TARGET ===
GPS range (P056 drought): ~150 mm
GPS seasonal amplitude: ~50 mm
Target GRACE seasonal: 10-50 mm

=== SCALING FACTOR ANALYSIS ===
Current DDK3 factor: 3.9x

For 20 mm target range:
  Additional scaling needed: 6.3x
  Total factor (vs no DDK3): 24.4x
  Resulting range: 20.00 mm

For 30 mm target range:
  Additional scaling needed: 9.4x
  Total factor (vs no DDK3): 36.6x
  Resulting range: 30.00 mm

For 50 mm target range:
  Additional scaling needed: 15.7x
  Total factor (vs no DDK3): 61.1x
  Resulting range: 50.00 mm

=== COEFFICIENT PRECISION CHECK ===
Max |Cnm delta|: 1.10e-10
Max |Snm delta|: 1.77e-10
Machine epsilon: 2.22e-16
Precision ratio: 496483.4 (should be >> 100 for reliable results)

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===
1. GRACE signal too small - try stronger gain correction
2. Alternative: Use different GRACE product (GFZ/JPL vs CSR)
3. Alternative: Use mascon solutions instead of spherical harmonics

# Static Reference Field Computation: Scientific Justification and Implementation

## Scientific Justification

### Overview: Why Static Reference Field Removal is Essential in GRACE Analysis

The `computeStaticReferenceField.m` function implements a fundamental preprocessing step in satellite gravimetry that is **scientifically essential** for isolating time-variable gravity signals from GRACE observations. This methodology is based on well-established principles in geodetic time series analysis and is standard practice in the GRACE research community.

### 1. Physical Basis: Earth's Gravity Field Decomposition

Earth's gravity field can be mathematically decomposed into two primary components:

```
g_total(θ, λ, t) = g_static(θ, λ) + g_variable(θ, λ, t)
```

Where:
- **g_static**: Time-invariant gravity field representing Earth's mean mass distribution
- **g_variable**: Time-variable gravity changes due to mass redistribution processes

The **static component** includes:
- Solid Earth's mean density structure
- Mean ocean and atmosphere distribution
- Long-term averaged hydrological states
- Glacial isostatic adjustment (very slow, ~constant over GRACE mission)

The **time-variable component** includes:
- Seasonal and interannual hydrological cycles
- Atmospheric mass redistribution
- Ocean mass variations
- Ice mass changes
- Tectonic deformation

### 2. Mathematical Foundation: Signal Isolation Theory

In spherical harmonics representation, the total gravity field coefficients are:

```
C_lm^total(t) = C_lm^static + ΔC_lm(t)
S_lm^total(t) = S_lm^static + ΔS_lm(t)
```

To isolate the time-variable signals **ΔC_lm(t)** and **ΔS_lm(t)**, we must remove the static field:

```
ΔC_lm(t) = C_lm^total(t) - C_lm^static
ΔS_lm(t) = S_lm^total(t) - S_lm^static
```

**The static field is estimated as the temporal mean**:

```
C_lm^static = (1/N) ∑[i=1 to N] C_lm^total(t_i)
S_lm^static = (1/N) ∑[i=1 to N] S_lm^total(t_i)
```

This mathematical approach assumes that time-variable signals have **zero mean** over the reference period, which is valid for most geophysical processes of interest.

### 3. Reference Period Selection: 2002-2006 Justification

The function uses **2002-2006** as the reference period, which is **scientifically optimal** for several reasons:

**3.1 GRACE Mission Timeline**
- GRACE launched: March 2002
- Data quality: Best during early mission (2002-2010)
- 2002-2006 represents 5 years of high-quality observations

**3.2 California Hydrology Context**
- **Pre-drought conditions**: 2002-2006 represents relatively normal hydrological conditions
- **2012-2016 California drought**: Using 2002-2006 as baseline preserves the drought signal
- **Seasonal balance**: 5-year period captures multiple complete hydrological cycles

**3.3 Geophysical Considerations**
- **Minimal anthropogenic trends**: Early 2000s had less pronounced groundwater depletion
- **ENSO neutrality**: Period includes both El Niño and La Niña phases
- **Volcanic quiescence**: No major volcanic events affecting mass distribution

### 4. Literature Support and Standard Practice

This methodology is **well-established** in geodetic literature:

**Foundational Papers:**
- **Wahr et al. (1998)**: First theoretical framework for GRACE time-variable gravity analysis
- **Tapley et al. (2004)**: GRACE mission design and data processing standards
- **Swenson & Wahr (2006)**: Post-processing methods including reference field removal

**Standard Practice:**
- **NASA/JPL GRACE processing**: Uses temporal mean removal
- **CSR GRACE solutions**: Implements reference field subtraction
- **GFZ processing chains**: Employs static field removal as standard

**Recent Applications:**
- Fu & Freymueller (2012): GPS-GRACE comparison using static field removal
- Karegar et al. (2015): Coastal loading studies with reference field subtraction
- All major GRACE hydrology studies use this approach

### 5. Physical Interpretation: What We're Removing vs. Preserving

**Removed (Static Field):**
- Mean continental water storage
- Average ocean mass distribution
- Long-term ice sheet equilibrium
- Solid Earth's background gravity

**Preserved (Time-Variable Signals):**
- Seasonal hydrological cycles (±50 mm water equivalent)
- Drought and flood anomalies (±100 mm water equivalent)
- Ice mass loss trends (1-10 mm/year water equivalent)
- Atmospheric mass redistributions

This separation is **crucial** for detecting cm-level crustal deformation caused by surface loading.

### 6. Impact on Crustal Deformation Analysis

For GPS-GRACE comparison, static field removal is **essential** because:

**6.1 GPS Observations**
- GPS measures **relative position changes** from a reference epoch
- GPS time series are typically **detrended** to remove long-term motions
- GPS captures **dynamic crustal response** to loading variations

**6.2 GRACE-to-Deformation Conversion**
- Loading Love numbers relate **mass changes** to **surface deformation**
- Static mass loads produce **static deformation** (unobservable by GPS)
- **Time-variable** mass loads produce **time-variable deformation** (GPS observable)

**6.3 Consistency Requirement**
- For meaningful GPS-GRACE comparison, both datasets must represent **variations** from a reference state
- Static field removal ensures GRACE represents **anomalies**, matching GPS **anomalies**

### Lines 6-27: File Discovery and Date Parsing

```matlab
gfc_files = dir(fullfile(grace_dir, '*BA01*.gfc'));
reference_files = {};
reference_dates = [];
for i = 1:length(gfc_files)
    filename = gfc_files(i).name;
    pattern = 'GSM-2_(\\d{7})-(\\d{7})_';
    tokens = regexp(filename, pattern, 'tokens');
    if ~isempty(tokens)
        start_date = str2double(tokens{1}{1});
        end_date = str2double(tokens{1}{2});
        start_year = floor(start_date / 1000);
        end_year = floor(end_date / 1000);
        if any(start_year == reference_years) || any(end_year == reference_years)
            reference_files{end+1} = filename;
            start_doy = mod(start_date, 1000);
            end_doy = mod(end_date, 1000);
            mid_year = (start_year + end_year) / 2;
            mid_decimal_year = mid_year + (start_doy + end_doy) / (2 * 365.25);
            reference_dates(end+1) = mid_decimal_year;
        end
    end
end
```

**Scientific Context**:
- **File naming convention**: `GSM-2_YYYYDDD-YYYYDDD_XXXX_BA01_XXXX.gfc`
- **YYYYDDD format**: Year + Day-of-Year (e.g., 2003045 = Day 45 of 2003)
- **Monthly solutions**: Each file represents ~30-day averaging period

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Regular expression parsing**: Extracts start/end dates from filenames
- **Temporal filtering**: Selects only files within reference period [2002-2006]
- **Mid-point calculation**: Uses temporal center of each monthly solution
- **Decimal year conversion**: Enables chronological sorting and interpolation

**Physical Significance**:
- Each GRACE file represents one month of gravity field observations
- Mid-point dating accounts for the ~30-day integration period of each solution

### Lines 28-30: Temporal Sorting

```matlab
n_files = length(reference_files);
[reference_dates, sort_idx] = sort(reference_dates);
reference_files = reference_files(sort_idx);
```

**Scientific Context**: 
- Chronological processing ensures proper temporal averaging
- Required for consistent coefficient accumulation across time series

### Lines 31-44: C20 Coefficient Data Loading

```matlab
fid = fopen(c20_file, 'r');
c20_data = [];
while ~feof(fid)
    line = fgetl(fid);
    if ischar(line) && ~startsWith(strtrim(line), '#') && ~isempty(strtrim(line))
        nums = str2num(line);
        if ~isempty(nums) && length(nums) >= 2
            c20_data = [c20_data; nums(1:2)];
        end
    end
end
fclose(fid);
c20_time = c20_data(:, 1);
c20_values = c20_data(:, 2);
```

**Scientific Context**:
- **C20 replacement necessity**: GRACE C20 coefficients are contaminated by satellite orbital errors
- **SLR solution**: Satellite Laser Ranging provides more accurate C20 determination
- **Standard practice**: All GRACE analyses replace C20 with SLR values

**Technical Implementation**:
- **File format**: Two columns [decimal_year, C20_coefficient]
- **Comment handling**: Skips lines beginning with '#'
- **Data validation**: Ensures proper numeric parsing

**Physical Significance**:
- C20 represents Earth's flattening (J2 coefficient)
- Critical for accurate mass change quantification
- Replacement improves signal accuracy by ~factor of 2-3

### Lines 45-57: Matrix Initialization

```matlab
first_file = fullfile(grace_dir, reference_files{1});
fid = fopen(first_file, 'r');
temp_data = [];
while ~feof(fid)
    line = fgetl(fid);
    if ischar(line) && startsWith(strtrim(line), 'gfc')
        parts = str2num(line(4:end));
        if length(parts) >= 4
            temp_data = [temp_data; parts(1:4)];
        end
    end
end
fclose(fid);
cnm_sum = zeros(nmax + 1, nmax + 1);
snm_sum = zeros(nmax + 1, nmax + 1);
valid_count = 0;
```

**Scientific Context**:
- **GFC format**: "gfc l m Clm Slm sigma_Clm sigma_Slm" per line

            parts = str2num(line(4:end));
            if length(parts) >= 4
                temp_data = [temp_data; parts(1:4)];
            end
        end
    end
    fclose(fid);
    [cnm, snm] = readSHC(temp_data, nmax);
    c20_interp = interp1(c20_time, c20_values, current_time, 'linear', 'extrap');
    cnm(3, 1) = c20_interp;
    cnm_sum = cnm_sum + cnm;
    snm_sum = snm_sum + snm;
    valid_count = valid_count + 1;
end
```

**Scientific Context**:
- **Monthly processing**: Each iteration processes one monthly GRACE solution
- **Coefficient accumulation**: Sums all coefficients across reference period
- **C20 replacement**: Substitutes SLR-derived C20 for each epoch

**Technical Implementation**:
- **File I/O**: Reads .gfc format coefficient data
- **Matrix conversion**: Uses readSHC() to convert to coefficient matrices
- **Interpolation**: Linear interpolation of C20 time series to GRACE epochs
- **Matrix indexing**: cnm(3,1) corresponds to C20 coefficient (l=2, m=0)

**Physical Significance**:
- **Temporal integration**: Accumulates gravity field observations over 5-year period
- **Signal averaging**: Random noise decreases as √N, systematic signals preserved
- **C20 correction**: Ensures accurate representation of Earth's flattening changes

### Lines 83-85: Final Averaging and Output

```matlab
cnm_static = cnm_sum / valid_count;
snm_static = snm_sum / valid_count;
end
```

**Scientific Context**:
- **Arithmetic mean**: Computes temporal average of spherical harmonic coefficients
- **Static field definition**: Mean field represents Earth's time-invariant gravity structure

**Mathematical Basis**:
```
C_lm^static = (1/N) ∑[i=1 to N] C_lm(t_i)
S_lm^static = (1/N) ∑[i=1 to N] S_lm(t_i)
```

**Physical Significance**:
- **Reference state**: Establishes baseline for time-variable analysis
- **Zero-mean assumption**: Assumes geophysical signals average to zero over reference period
- **Quality assurance**: Division by valid_count handles potential missing data

## Integration with Main Analysis Pipeline

### Usage Context in main_grace_analysis.m

```matlab
% Lines 133-136
reference_years = 2002:2006;
[cnm_static, snm_static] = computeStaticReferenceField(grace_dir, c20_file, deg1_file, reference_years, nmax);

% Lines 142-143  
cnm_delta = cnm_abs - cnm_static;
snm_delta = snm_abs - snm_static;
```

**Scientific Integration**:
1. **Static field computation**: Creates 5-year reference field (2002-2006)
2. **Time series processing**: For each monthly GRACE solution, subtracts static field
3. **Anomaly isolation**: Results in time-variable coefficients Δcnm(t), Δsnm(t)
4. **Deformation calculation**: Converts anomalies to surface displacement using Love numbers

### Impact on GPS-GRACE Comparison

**Consistency Achievement**:
- **GPS detrending**: GPS time series are polynomial-detrended to remove long-term motion
- **GRACE static removal**: GRACE time series have static field removed to isolate variations
- **Comparable signals**: Both datasets now represent deviations from reference states

**Physical Validation**:
- **Expected magnitudes**: Time-variable signals should be 1-2 orders smaller than total field
- **Seasonal patterns**: Should show clear hydrological seasonality (±20-50 mm water equivalent)
- **Correlation potential**: Enables meaningful correlation analysis between GPS and GRACE
